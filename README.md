# Last Hammer

Last Hamer is a pre-built platform for creating applications, as if you were working with a framework; but particularly it has a graphical interface that allows starting in the following way:
-   Configure the System data.
-   Configure the Client / User / Company data.
-   Raise the system structure, based on form screens:
    -   Maintenance.
    -   Process stages screens.
    -   Approvals.
    -   Reports and Lists.

Note: It also has support for the Execution of Crons Jobs; but requires access to the System Cron Task Manager

## PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR3

-   Namespaces and classes must have the following structure () \*
-   Each namespace must have a superior namespace ("Vendor name").
-   Each namespace can have as many sub-namespaces as desired.
-   Names of namespaces or classes must be separated by an underscore (\_).
-   All files must have the extension .php.
-   The names of the namespaces or classes must be sorted alphabetically.

#### (The architecture proposed will not use namespace, lol)

-   Files should only use UTF-8 encoding without BOM.
-   Functions should only return a single value (it can be an array).
-   Space names and classes must follow the rules of the PSR-0.
-   Class names must be written using the StudlyCaps technique.
-   The constants must be defined in UPPERCASE and using underscore (\_) as separator.
-   Methods and functions should be written using the camelCase technique.
-   The idea must be with a tabulator set to 4 spaces (tabs or spaces).
-   The constants true, false and null must be written in lowercase.
-   You should no longer use the reserved word var to declare a property, you must use public, private, static or protected.
-   There must be a space after each control structure (if, for, foreach, while, switch, try ... catch, etc.).
