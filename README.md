# Last Hammer

Last Hamer is a pre-built platform for creating applications, as if you were working with a framework; but particularly it has a graphical interface that allows starting in the following way:
-   Configure the System data.
-   Configure the Client / User / Company data.
-   Raise the system structure, based on form screens:
    -   Maintenance.
    -   Process stages screens.
    -   Approvals.
    -   Reports and Lists.

Note: It also has support for the Execution of Crons Jobs; but requires access to the System Cron Task Manager

## What you need to know when starting development:

Mainly used PHP in its latest version 7.4
HTML5 and a custom version of Bootstrap will also be used simply to enrich the color palette (Bootstrap 4.5).
Also CSS3 is used and in the Extensions area you will find the additional libraries and their versions.

## PSR version:

Last-Hammer does not use a specific version of PSR or code style, we can really consider that an anti-pattern is used, and all the system is embedded in the defined objects and constants, this will be better explained in the definition of classes, functions, variables and constants.

#### (The architecture proposed)

-   to be defined
